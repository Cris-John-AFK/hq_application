- **Integrated Audit Trail**: Every asset modification (Create, Update, Delete, Import) is automatically captured in the global security journal for financial transparency.
- **Advanced Audit Toolbar**: Instant real-time searching by **Serial Number**, **Asset Nomenclature**, or **Technical Description** with multi-criteria category filters.

### 📁 Advanced Leave & Masterlist Management
- **Unified Masterlist Support**: Seamlessly manage leave for both system users and "Masterlist Employees" (staff without digital accounts) with 100% data parity.
- **Advanced Archive Registry**: Featuring a Windows 11-inspired Explorer navigation system. Records are categorized into secure "Folders":
    - **Leave Request Archive**: Structured by Year and Month for high-density historical lookup.
    - **Employee Masterlist Archive**: A dedicated registry for archived/off-boarded personnel, keeping the active workspace clutter-free.
- **Soft-Delete Maintenance**: High-performance administrative tool to mass-archive legacy records using smart date thresholds (30, 60, or 90 days ago) with a single click.
- **One-Click Restoration**: Full data integrity fallback allowing administrators to restore any archived record or employee back to the active list instantly.
- **Admin-Filing with Auto-Approval**: Administrators can bypass approval workflows by filing leaves directly on behalf of employees, triggering instant credit deductions.
- **Streamlined Personnel Management**: Simplified primary employee views by removing credit management and non-essential contact fields (like email) from the masterlist to prioritize high-density organizational data.
- **Disciplinary Metadata Tracking**: New **Attendance Category** system allows administrators to classify leaves (UA, WMC, WD, UH) for advanced absenteeism reporting.
- **Conflict Prevention**: Intelligent overlap validation prevents filing duplicate requests for the same date.
- **Precision SIL Tracking**: Automated Service Incentive Leave (SIL) system with 100% accurate numeric deductions and restorations, managed through dedicated leave modules rather than the masterlist.

## 🏎️ Performance & Development Speed

The development environment is optimized for maximum "snappiness" by leveraging a hybrid server architecture:

### **Why is `localhost:5173` faster?**
- **Vite Engine**: Port 5173 is powered by **Vite**, which uses native ES modules and a high-performance Go-based pre-bundler. It is designed for near-instant asset delivery and **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**.
- **Zero Overhead**: Unlike the backend which must boot the entire Laravel framework for every request, 5173 only serves exactly what the browser needs at that millisecond.

### **The Hybrid Workflow**
We have implemented a **Development Proxy** in `vite.config.js`. You can now use `localhost:5173` as your main entry point for a faster UI experience:
- **UI & Assets**: Served directly by Vite at lightspeed on 5173.
- **API & Data**: Automatically proxied to Laravel on 8000 in the background.

## 🛡️ Security & Action Audit Trail
- **Comprehensive Action Logging**: Every administrative move—including **Excel Exports**, **Bulk Imports**, **Setting Changes**, and **Bulletin Updates**—is recorded in the Audit Trail.
- **Granular Change Tracking**: Profile updates log "Old vs New" data snapshots for technical review and security monitoring.
- **Native Automated Backups**: Integrated `php artisan backup:daily` system with 7-day automated rotation.
- **Granular Authorization**: Strict Laravel **Policies** control every action, ensuring users only see what they own.
- **Global API Protection**: Built-in **Rate Limiting** (`throttle:120,1`) to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse.
- **Safe Transactions**: Multi-table updates (Credits + Status) are wrapped in atomic database transactions.
